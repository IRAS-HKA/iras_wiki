## Creating new Wiki Pages using Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. If you have already dealt with the topic or are now doing a little research, you will notice that not every tool uses the same Markdown syntax. For our purposes especially the so called GitLab Flavoured Markdown ([GLFM](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html)) is necessary. Under this link you will find all important hints on how to handle Markdown documents. We recommend using Visual Studio Code with a Markdown Extension to create these files. This [page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) lists the basic syntax necessary to create formatted markdown pages.
