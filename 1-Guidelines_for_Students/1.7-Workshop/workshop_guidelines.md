## Information

During your work, you may need tools or materials from our workshop. If this is the case, please be sure to follow general workshop rules: 
- Work carefully and watch for sharp edges as well as spinning tools.
- **ALWAYS** clean up after yourself. The workshop is also used by many others, so put used tools where they belong. 
- If you have no experience working with machine tools, please be sure to ask one of the contacts listed above for a brief introduction. There is a great risk of injury and no shame in asking for help.
- Should you take the last item out of a box, place the respective Kanban card in the container provided on the workbench countertop.
- If you remove an item completely from the workshop, for example a spool of PLA filament went empty, log this into our [ERP](https://www.w.hs-karlsruhe.de/gitlab/iras/common/wiki/-/blob/wiki/1-Guidelines_for_Students/1.7-Workshop/erp.md) program. 
- Clean tools properly after use. 
- If possible, avoid strong chipping activities in the direct vicinity of the active 3D printer. 
- Follow the rules for using the [3D printer](https://www.w.hs-karlsruhe.de/gitlab/iras/common/instructions/print3d). 
- Report missing or defective items immediately to one of the contacts listed above. 


## FAQ

  <summary>I think item `abc` should be standard in any workshop and i cannot find it.</summary>
  
  > As unlikely as it seems, you might have missed it. Take a look at the `search` function in our [ERP](https://www.w.hs-karlsruhe.de/gitlab/iras/common/wiki/-/blob/wiki/1-Guidelines_for_Students/1.7-Workshop/erp.md) System. If the item is not listed or is not in its designated place, contact one of the contacts and we will decide on getting the item.

  <summary>I have not been able to find an item in the system although in reality it is in stock.</summary>
  
  > Unfortunately, not all our items are registered with their correct designation yet. If the item does not have a barcode, please add it to the [ERP](https://www.w.hs-karlsruhe.de/gitlab/iras/common/wiki/-/blob/wiki/1-Guidelines_for_Students/1.7-Workshop/erp.md) system. Please follow the instructions for creating a new item.
